# Markdown

On the [start page](https://github.com/Practical-Python-2025W/sessions) of this repo, you'll find a short text about the repository. While its text may appear to be rendered HTML, it actually comes from a humble Markdown (md) file placed in this repository.  
Markdown is a very simple markup language that is widely used to document what we are doing (on GitHub, GitLab, etc.). It is not really useful for storing or transferring data. Instead, it should be used to structure textual data in a way that makes it readable and accessible.

If your file fulfills the following conditions, GitHub will assume you want it to be rendered like this for people using your repository:  
1. It has to be a Markdown file.
2. It has to be named `README.md`.
3. It has to be placed in the root folder of your repository.

If you're wondering (as you should, to some extent) how Markdown works, check out some of the links below. Open this file in VS Code and edit it on your local system. If you install a Markdown plugin, you will be able to render the file locally as it would be rendered on GitHub.
